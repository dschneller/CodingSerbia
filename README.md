CodingSerbia
============

Sample Application for the CodingSerbia 2013 conference.

If you want to see the application slowly "evolve", make sure to look at the tags for the commits.
From `step-01` to `step-10` you can watch features being added and code being cleaned up.

I also tried to provide rather long commit messages to better understand what was changed with each step. Looking at the diffs between the commits might also prove useful to understand which parts of the code were changed to achieve a particular goal.

The last iteration adds a category that swizzles the implementation for `UIView` constructors to highlight each individual view using a colored border.
