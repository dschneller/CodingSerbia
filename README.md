CodingSerbia
============

Sample Application for the CodingSerbia 2013 conference.

If you want to see the application slowly "evolve", make sure to look at the tags for the commits.
From `step-01` to `step-10` you can watch features being added and code being cleaned up.

The last iteration adds a category that swizzles the implementation for `UIView` constructors to highlight each individual view using a colored border.
